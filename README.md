# Simple Voting App

## Project Title
Simple Voting App

## Project Description
Simple Voting App is a basic blockchain-based voting contract written in Solidity. It allows users to vote for predefined candidates, ensures that each address can vote only once, and stores all votes transparently on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to demonstrate how blockchain can be used to build a transparent and tamper-resistant voting system. It is designed as a beginner-friendly example to understand core concepts like smart contracts, state variables, mappings, and basic access control.

## Key Features
- Predefined list of candidates initialized at deployment.
- One-person-one-vote: each address can vote only once.
- Owner-controlled voting window (open/close voting).
- Automatic counting of votes and a function to get the current leading candidate.
- Public data: anyone can read candidates and vote counts directly from the blockchain.

## Future Scope
- Add voter registration/whitelisting to restrict who can vote.
- Add time-based start and end for voting (using block timestamps).
- Improve privacy using off-chain identity or encryption approaches.
- Build a frontend (web or mobile) to interact with the contract easily.
- Support multiple elections by reusing or extending the contract.
